2. Key Milestones in the Evolution of Software Engineering
A.	1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering: - Introduced the term "software engineering" to address the software crisis caused by rising project failures.
B.	Introduction of Structured Programming (1970s): - Promoted modular, well-structured code, replacing unstructured programming.
C.	Rise of Agile Methodology (2001): - Agile Manifesto introduced iterative development, emphasizing flexibility and customer collaboration.

3. Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that guides the development of software applications through a series of well-defined phases. Here's a simple overview of each phase:
1.	Requirement Analysis: In this initial phase, developers work closely with stakeholders to gather and document what the users need from the software. This ensures a clear understanding of the desired features and functionalities.
2.	Planning: Based on the gathered requirements, the team defines the project's scope, estimates costs, and sets a timeline. This phase involves outlining the resources needed and identifying potential risks to create a solid project plan.
3.	Design: Here, the software's architecture is crafted. Developers decide on the overall structure and design the user interface, ensuring the software will be user-friendly and meet the specified requirements.
4.	Development: In this phase, programmers write the actual code based on the design documents. They build the software's components, integrating them to function as a cohesive system.
5.	Testing: After development, the software undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues. This ensures the application functions correctly, securely, and efficiently under various conditions.
6.	Deployment: Once tested and approved, the software is released to users. This phase involves installing the application in a live environment and making it available for use.
7.	Maintenance: Post-deployment, the software requires ongoing support. This includes updating the software to adapt to changes, fixing any new issues that arise, and making improvements based on user feedback.


4. Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies
a.	The Waterfall methodology follows a sequential, phase-by-phase approach, where each stage of development must be completed before moving to the next. In contrast, the Agile methodology is iterative and allows continuous development and improvement throughout the project lifecycle.
b.	When it comes to flexibility, Waterfall is rigid and difficult to modify once development begins, whereas Agile is highly adaptable, making it easier to incorporate changes as needed.
c.	Regarding testing, Waterfall defers testing until the end of the development process, which can lead to late discovery of issues. Agile, on the other hand, integrates continuous testing at every iteration, allowing for early bug detection and resolution.
d.	In terms of documentation, Waterfall relies on extensive upfront documentation, ensuring a well-defined roadmap before development begins. Agile, however, prioritizes working software over detailed documentation, allowing documentation to evolve as the project progresses.
e.	Finally, customer involvement in Waterfall is limited after the initial requirements gathering phase, meaning that feedback is typically not incorporated until the final product is delivered. Agile promotes active collaboration with customers throughout the project, ensuring that their feedback continuously shapes the development process.

Examples:
•	Waterfall: Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, like banking software.
•	Agile: Best for evolving projects, such as mobile app development.

5. Roles in a Software Engineering Team
In a software engineering team, each member plays a specific role to ensure the successful development and delivery of software products. Here's a simple overview of three key roles:
1. Software Developer:
•	Writes, tests, and maintains code: Developers are responsible for creating the software by writing code, ensuring it functions correctly through testing, and updating it as needed.
•	Develops new features and fixes bugs: They add new capabilities to the software and resolve any issues or errors that arise.
2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:
•	Ensures software meets requirements: QA engineers verify that the software aligns with the specified needs and expectations.
•	Conducts automated and manual testing: They perform tests, both using tools (automated) and by hand (manual), to identify and help fix defects in the software.
3. Project Manager:
•	Oversees project execution, timelines, and resources: Project managers plan and monitor the project's progress, ensuring it stays on schedule and within budget.
•	Coordinates between teams and stakeholders: They act as a bridge between the development team and other parties, facilitating communication and collaboration.

6. Importance of IDEs and VCS in Software Development
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
•	Provide code editing, debugging, and testing tools in one platform.
•	Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse.
Version Control Systems (VCS)
•	Track changes, manage collaboration, and allow rollbacks.
•	Examples: Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), Subversion (SVN).

7. Common Challenges Faced by Software Engineers & Solutions
Software engineers often encounter several common challenges during development. Here's a simple overview of these challenges and their solutions:
1.	Managing Changing Requirements:
Challenge: Project requirements can evolve, making it difficult to keep the development process on track.
Solution: Adopt Agile methodologies, which promote flexibility and iterative progress, allowing teams to adapt to changes efficiently.
2.	Debugging and Bug Fixes:
Challenge: Identifying and resolving errors in complex codebases can be time-consuming and challenging.
Solution: Implement rigorous testing procedures and conduct regular code reviews to catch issues early and maintain code quality.
3.	Meeting Deadlines:
Challenge: Delivering projects on time requires careful planning and resource management.
Solution: Utilize project management tools like Jira or Trello to organize tasks, track progress, and ensure timely completion.
4.	Security Vulnerabilities:
Challenge: Protecting software from security threats is crucial but can be complex.
Solution: Follow secure coding practices and conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

8. Types of Software Testing and Their Importance
Software testing is a crucial process in software development, ensuring that applications function correctly and meet user expectations. Here's a simple overview of four primary types of software testing and their importance:
1.	Unit Testing:
Purpose: Tests individual components or functions of the software to ensure each part works correctly in isolation.
Importance: Helps identify and fix bugs early in the development process, improving code quality and reducing errors in later stages.
2.	Integration Testing:
Purpose: Verifies that different modules or services within an application work together as intended.
Importance: Ensures that combined components function seamlessly, identifying issues in interactions between integrated units.
3.	System Testing:
Purpose: Evaluates the complete and integrated software application to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
Importance: Assesses the system's overall behavior and performance, ensuring that the application operates as expected in a production-like environment.
4.	Acceptance Testing:
Purpose: Validates the software against user needs and requirements, often conducted by end-users or clients.
Importance: Determines whether the software is ready for deployment by ensuring it meets the acceptance criteria and is fit for purpose.


#Part2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
